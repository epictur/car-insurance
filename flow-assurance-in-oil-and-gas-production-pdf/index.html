<p>Our team has a wide range of experience as both consultants and as clients and we aim to provide competent friendly direct support. In many cases ambient water temperatures surrounding flowlines and pipelines fall below those needed to prevent hydrate crystal growth in hydrocarbons for the typically high flowing pressures leading to potential for forming large. Flow assurance refers to succesfully maintaining sustained hydrocarbon production by properly managing the flow oil gas and water without slugging or restrictsblockages due to undesired phase changesThe term originally covered the thermal hydraulic analysis and evaluation of potential production problems associated with solids formation such as waxes asphaltenes hydrates and scale. The plateau production of the field is 20 MSm3d thus it produces around 120 Sm3d of water or equivalently 120 000. Flow assurance engineers commonly analyze the flow of oil and gas in wells.
