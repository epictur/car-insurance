<p>Flow loops which can simulate pipeline fluid flow aid in mimicking the deepwater conditions under which the products must be functional. More deepwater projects are also using seawater flooding that will result in potential scale formation and require sophisticated scale inhibitor treatment programs to prevent flow assurance issues. By evaluating these issues early in theproject development phase relatively simple design changes can be made thatsignificantly reduce the operating complexity of the project. The effects of these problems in subsea pipelines explore the new Cold flow technology as a means of tackling these flow assurance problems. What compounds the flow assurance task even further is that these solid deposits can interact with each other and can cause catastrophic blockage formation in pipelines and result in flow assurance failure.

More deepwater projects are also using seawater flooding that will result in potential scale formation and require sophisticated scale inhibitor treatment programs to prevent flow assurance issues. Flow assurances strategies are the bulwark of an efficient operation encompassing three main approaches prevention in the first instance remediation if issues are detected and optimisation strategies to improve overall effectiveness. As offshore production continues to move into more complex and deeper-water subsea fields the flow assurance focus is shifting to product performance optimization chemical stability under challenging conditions and environmentally friendly chemistries to prevent what otherwise could be costly problems related to hydrates paraffins asphaltenes scales.

By definition flow assurance focuses on the entire engineering and production lifecycle from the reservoir through processing and refining to ensure that hydrocarbons can be moved from the reservoir to the refinery smoothly and without interruption. Identifying and characterising flow assurance issues. By evaluating these issues early in theproject development phase relatively simple design changes can be made thatsignificantly reduce the operating complexity of the project. To prevent flow assurance problems its necessary to identify potential issues then determine how best to resolve those issues.

More deepwater projects are also using seawater flooding that will result in potential scale formation and require sophisticated scale inhibitor treatment programs to prevent flow assurance issues. Flow loops which can simulate pipeline fluid flow aid in mimicking the deepwater conditions under which the products must be functional. The main goal of flow assurance studies is simple.

<p>Flow assurance can keep offshore wells productive and it requires successfully preventing or mitigating problems in the reservoir the subsea flowlines and the topsides equipment. Flow assurance refers to the successful and economical flow of hydrocarbon streams from the reservoir to the point of sale. Flow assurance challenges production from deeper water. More deepwater projects are also using seawater flooding that will result in potential scale formation and require sophisticated scale inhibitor treatment programs to prevent flow assurance issues.

<p>Flow assurance issues mainly involve the formation of hydrates corrosion asphaltenes slugging and emulsions 2. The main issues considered when designing gas condensate systems are usually pressure drop liquid handling and hydrate prevention. What compounds the flow assurance task even further is that these solid deposits can interact with each other and can cause catastrophic blockage formation in pipelines and result in flow assurance failure. In others it could be multiple deposits across several kilometers of pipeline. This suggested that more information was needed on the location type and size of the pipeline blockage.

<p>In this work theflow assurance risks consisted of hydrate and ice formation material integrityissues due to low operating temperatures and potential issues regarding themultiphase flow. Flow loops which can simulate pipeline fluid flow aid in mimicking the deepwater conditions under which the products must be functional. The focus of the research project is to study the major flow assurance problems in subsea production pipelines. Flow assurance will continue to remain critical technology as deepwater developments progress and as longer tiebacks from subsea wellhead systems are considered. To prevent flow assurance problems its necessary to identify potential issues then determine how best to resolve those issues.

<p>However due to the nature of the reservoirs these issues tend towards the extreme. 14 Reasons Justification for Project Petroleum contains a variety of light and heavy hydrocarbons wherein. In some cases it is clear where the blockage or issue is. One of the most critical challenges facing producers today is assuring oil and gas flow through complex and costly long subsea. Flow assurances strategies are the bulwark of an efficient operation encompassing three main approaches prevention in the first instance remediation if issues are detected and optimisation strategies to improve overall effectiveness.
