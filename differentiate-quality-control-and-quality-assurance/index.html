Whereas QA is ensuring that the processes and methods used while developing that product are correct. QA does not assure quality rather it creates and ensures the processes are being followed to assure quality. Theyre aimed at eliminating process variation through the creation revision and implementation of explicitly defined procedures that ensure the quality of a product when followed precisely. Typically QA activities and responsibilities cover virtually all of the quality system in one fashion or another while QC is a subset of the QA activities.
