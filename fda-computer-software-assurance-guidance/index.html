<p>The FDA realizing this is counterproductive initiated the CSA Computer Software Assurance guidelines so that 80 of the manufacturers time is spent on critical thinking and testing and only 20 of their time in documentation. In this blog we will discuss some of the key components of CSA along with best practices for making the shift. The FDA is expected to release its new guidance around CSA Computer Software Assurance for Manufacturing Operations and Quality Systems Software before the end of 2020. The FDA is leaning towards a Case for Quality CfQ approach with less emphasis on a compliance approach allowing device. For FDA purposes this guidance applies to any software related to a regulated medical device as defined by Section 201h of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.
