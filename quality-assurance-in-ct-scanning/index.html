<p>Numerous CT performance-evaluation procedures have been described in the literature but they are generally unsuitable for routine quality-assurance QA testing. There must be careful selection of technical parameters that control exposure of the patient and the display of the images and also regular checking of scanner performance with measurement of physical image parameters as part of program of quality assurance for achieving accredited status for CT through the American College of Radiology ACR. The data we have presented from the ROSEL trial quality assurance guidelines can be used to improve 4D-CT scanning protocols in the participating institutions and to implement 4D-CT scan protocols safely and accurately at other institutions. To ensure harm from radiation is minimised by using as low a dose of radiation as possible. Objective To ensure CT scanning equipment is safe and effective.
